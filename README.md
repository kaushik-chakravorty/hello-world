Hello! i am new to Python and i have been learning it for 2 months now and i find it exthrallingly interesting.
i am also new to GIThub and i mad emy first commit today. it consists of a series of programs that i have created
while practicing problems related to python. This is also my first ever repository, and to be a honest, a premature one, as 
i am not sure how much beneficial it will be  for the other users here.
But with due course of time i will improve and upload new and hugely relevant repositories. Peace!
